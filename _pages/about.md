I am a second-year graduate student at Rice University, working with Professor Xia Hu. My current research focuses on LLMs prompting and LLMs application to health care.  Before that, I obtained my undergraduate degree at Boston College. While at Boston College, I have worked with Prof. Jose Bento on theoretical deep learning and Prof. Stefano Anzellotti on computational neuroscience. I have also interned at Prof. Anima Anandkumar's lab at Caltech as a summer undergraduate research fellow (SURF) working on using computer vision for physical reasoning

My general research interest lies in the intersection of human intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI): How to make AI better for humans to use and understand human intelligence and how to use human intelligence to build better AI.
